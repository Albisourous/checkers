# Checkers

A simple Checkers game made using Java and Eclipse.

## Background

This project was created to test my experience in Java. Looking back at it now I can see many aspects where I can make improvements in my code and UI. Additionally, my code organization has improved greatly since working on this project. 

## Features
```
Music: The user has the option to play music when the application is launched.
Classic mode: Standard checkers rule set where if you have the option to take a piece you must take it.
Free mode: Checkers where the user has the option to decide what move they have and aren't forced to take a piece.
